# LAMP-TutorialCenterReservationConsole

The Tutorial Center Reservation Console (TCRC) is website that allows both students and tutors to find a location and time that would allow tutors to provide physical tutoring services at the Snapask Academy.

The objective of TCRC is to allow tutors to select time slots during which they are available to offer their services to students. The time slots are 30 minutes each and Snpask Academy is open for business Monday to Sunday from 9:00AM to 10:00PM. So, time slots will be from 09:00-09:30, 09:30-10:00.... 21:30-22:00 everyday. Once tutors have published their time slots, students can then choose the time slots during which they would like to attend tutorials.
